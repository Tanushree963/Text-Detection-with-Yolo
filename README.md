# Text-Detection-with-Yolo
In this project I have used a popular object detection algorithm Yolo v3 to detect in scene type images.
Optical character recognition is one the most popular computer vision tasks and in order to recognise text we must first detect it.

Natural scene text detection is one of the 
challenging task in computer vision.This is because the text in
 natural scene has too much variability in font,
 illumination condition, less text and more non 
text region. Unlike the mnsit data set where we
 have handwritten digits with well foreground and 
background it becomes very easy to work with in 
those kind of images.

In this work we have detected text by drawing a rectangular
bounding box around it.
